# Rakushki

Rakushki (Russian: ракушки, "The shells") is a collection of two tile matching games that run in a web browser.  The first is a recreation of the classic match-three game, Shariki (Russian: Ша́рики, "The Marbles"), better known by its successor Bejeweled.  The second is a new game, Bombi (Russian: бомбы, "The Bombs"), where groups of 4 tiles combine to make bombs, which can then create chain reactions.
